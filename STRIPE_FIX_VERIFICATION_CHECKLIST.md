## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Successful Payment Flow
1. **User Action**: Completes Stripe checkout for $9.99 monthly plan
2. **Stripe Event**: Sends `checkout.session.completed` webhook
3. **System Response**: 
   - Updates user database with full subscription details
   - Sets `subscriptionStatus: 'active'`
   - Sets `subscriptionPlan: 'monthly'`
   - Invalidates subscription cache
4. **User Experience**: Immediately sees "Premium Account" status
5. **Feature Access**: All premium features unlocked

### Database Updates Expected
```sql
-- User record should be updated with:
stripeCustomerId: 'cus_xxx'
subscriptionId: 'sub_xxx'
subscriptionStatus: 'active'
subscriptionPlan: 'monthly'
currentPeriodEnd: [30 days from now]
cancelAtPeriodEnd: false
```

### API Response Expected
```json
{
  "isPremium": true,
  "subscriptionStatus": "active",
  "plan": "stripe_monthly",
  "planName": "Stripe Monthly",
  "accountType": "premium",
  "accessLevel": "full"
}
```

## üö® Testing Instructions for Production

### 1. Pre-Deployment Testing
```bash
# Test webhook endpoints
node test-webhook-endpoint.js

# Test webhook event processing (requires test environment)
node test-stripe-webhook.js
```

### 2. Post-Deployment Verification
1. **Complete Test Purchase**:
   - Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Complete checkout for monthly plan
   - Verify immediate status update

2. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT email, subscriptionStatus, subscriptionPlan, stripeCustomerId 
   FROM User 
   WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```

3. **Verify UI Updates**:
   - Billing page shows "Premium Account"
   - Dashboard displays premium features
   - Premium gates allow access

4. **Test Premium Features**:
   - Social Security integration
   - PDF report generation
   - Combined calculations wizard
   - Unlimited saved calculations

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Monitor webhook delivery in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed webhook events
- [ ] Monitor subscription activation rates
- [ ] Track user upgrade success metrics

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Webhook Not Received
**Check:**
- Stripe webhook endpoint URL is correct
- Webhook secret matches environment variable
- Server is accessible from Stripe's servers
- No firewall blocking webhook requests

### Issue: Subscription Not Activated
**Check:**
- Database logs for webhook processing
- User record in database for subscription fields
- Stripe subscription status in dashboard
