# Massachusetts Retirement System Wizard - Automatic Salary Projection Feature

## Overview

The automatic retirement salary projection feature calculates the user's expected final salary at retirement based on their current salary input and projected Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA) raises. This feature provides more accurate pension benefit calculations by accounting for salary growth over time.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ **1. Trigger Mechanism**
- **Automatic Calculation**: When user enters current salary in wizard form, projection is automatically calculated and displayed
- **Real-time Updates**: Recalculates when user modifies current salary or retirement date
- **Smart Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing wizard flow without disrupting user experience

### ✅ **2. COLA Calculation Engine**
- **Massachusetts-Specific Rates**: Uses Massachusetts state employee COLA rates (2-3% annually)
- **Multiple Rate Options**:
  - Conservative: 2.0% annually
  - Typical: 2.5% annually (default)
  - Optimistic: 3.0% annually
- **Compound Growth Formula**: `Future Value = Present Value × (1 + rate)^years`

### ✅ **3. Data Sources Integration**
- **Current Salary**: From user input in wizard form
- **Planned Retirement Date**: From user profile or wizard input
- **Current Date**: Automatic system date for years-to-retirement calculation
- **Age-based Calculation**: Fallback using current age and planned retirement age

### ✅ **4. Display Components**
- **Full Display**: `SalaryProjectionDisplay` component with detailed breakdown
- **Compact Display**: `SalaryProjectionCompact` for inline use
- **Visual Elements**: 
  - Current vs projected salary comparison
  - Growth amount and percentage
  - Years to retirement
  - COLA rate used
  - Calculation method indicator

### ✅ **5. Pension Integration**
- **Enhanced Calculations**: `calculatePensionBenefit()` function now supports projected salary
- **Dual Display**: Shows both current and projected pension calculations
- **Automatic Selection**: Uses projected salary by default for more accurate estimates
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains option to use current salary for comparison

### ✅ **6. Validation & Error Handling**
- **Input Validation**: Handles zero/negative salaries, past retirement dates
- **COLA Rate Limits**: Validates COLA rates between 0% and 10%
- **Date Validation**: Ensures retirement date is in the future
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Falls back to current salary if projection fails

### ✅ **7. Real-time Updates**
- **Reactive Calculations**: Updates automatically when form data changes
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses React useMemo for efficient recalculation
- **Debounced Updates**: Prevents excessive recalculations during typing

### ✅ **8. User Experience**
- **Clear Labeling**: Projected values clearly marked as "Auto-calculated"
- **Educational Content**: Explains COLA assumptions and methodology
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Uses color coding and badges for easy identification
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device breakpoints

## Technical Implementation

### Core Files Created/Modified

#### **New Files:**
1. **`lib/salary-projection.ts`** - Core calculation engine
2. **`components/wizard/salary-projection-display.tsx`** - React display components
3. **`test-salary-projection-wizard.js`** - Comprehensive test suite

1. **`components/wizard/essential-information-step.tsx`** - Added projection display
2. **`components/wizard/combined-calculation-wizard.tsx`** - Enhanced pension calculations
3. **Wizard integration points** - Real-time updates and data flow

### Key Functions

#### **`calculateSalaryProjection(params)`**
```typescript
interface SalaryProjectionParams {
  currentSalary: number
  currentDate?: Date
  retirementDate?: Date | string
  retirementAge?: number
  currentAge?: number
  colaRate?: number
}
```

#### **`calculatePensionBenefit(useProjectedSalary: boolean)`**
- Enhanced to use projected salary when `useProjectedSalary = true`
- Falls back to current salary for comparison calculations
- Maintains all existing MSRB calculation methodology

### Integration Points

#### **Wizard Steps:**
1. **Essential Information Step**: Displays projection after salary input
2. **Pension Details Step**: Shows both current and projected pension calculations
3. **Review Step**: Uses projected salary for final benefit calculations

#### **Data Flow:**
```
User Input (Current Salary) 
  → Salary Projection Calculation 
  → Enhanced Pension Calculation 
  → Display Updates
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Salary Projection
```typescript
const projection = calculateSalaryProjection({
  currentSalary: 75000,
  currentAge: 45,
  retirementAge: 65,
  colaRate: 0.025 // 2.5%
})

// Result: ~$122,000 projected retirement salary
```

### Pension Calculation Integration
```typescript
// Current salary basis
const currentPension = calculatePensionBenefit(false)

// Projected salary basis  
const projectedPension = calculatePensionBenefit(true)

// Difference shows impact of salary growth
const improvement = projectedPension - currentPension
```

## Validation & Testing
