# Billing Page Button Functionality Test

## Test Summary
This document outlines the testing of the fixed billing page buttons in the Massachusetts Retirement System application.

## Fixed Issues

### ✅ **Problem 1: Non-functional "Update Payment Method" Button**
**Before:** Button had no onClick handler - clicking did nothing
**After:** Button now has proper functionality with loading states and error handling

**Expected Behavior:**
- For Premium users: Opens Stripe Customer Portal in new tab for payment method management
- For Free users: Redirects to subscription page (/subscribe)
- Shows loading state while processing
- Displays success/error messages
- Fallback to subscription portal page if Stripe portal fails

### ✅ **Problem 2: Non-functional "Manage Subscription" Button**
**Before:** Button had no onClick handler - clicking did nothing  
**After:** Button now navigates to subscription portal page with proper feedback

**Expected Behavior:**
- Navigates to /subscription/portal page
- Shows loading state while navigating
- Displays success message during navigation
- Error handling if navigation fails

## Implementation Details

### Added State Management
```typescript
const [isNavigating, setIsNavigating] = useState(false)
const [portalLoading, setPortalLoading] = useState(false)
const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [successMessage, setSuccessMessage] = useState<string | null>(null)
```

### Added Handler Functions
1. **handleUpdatePaymentMethod()** - Handles payment method updates
2. **handleManageSubscription()** - Handles subscription management navigation

### Added UI Enhancements
- Loading states with spinning icons
- Success/error message alerts with auto-dismiss
- Proper button disabled states during operations
- Accessible button labels and ARIA attributes

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Update Payment Method (Premium User)
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/billing
2. Ensure user is logged in with premium subscription
3. Click "Update Payment Method" button
4. **Expected:** Button shows loading state, then opens Stripe portal in new tab
5. **Expected:** Success message appears and auto-dismisses after 3 seconds

### Test Case 2: Update Payment Method (Free User)
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/billing  
2. Ensure user is logged in without premium subscription
3. Click "Update Payment Method" button
4. **Expected:** Button shows loading state, then redirects to /subscribe page
5. **Expected:** Success message appears before redirect

### Test Case 3: Manage Subscription
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/billing
2. Ensure user is logged in
3. Click "Manage Subscription" button
4. **Expected:** Button shows loading state, then navigates to /subscription/portal
5. **Expected:** Success message appears during navigation

### Test Case 4: Error Handling
1. Test with network disconnected or API errors
2. **Expected:** Error messages appear with fallback behavior
3. **Expected:** Buttons return to normal state after error

## Technical Implementation

### Button States
- **Normal:** Default appearance with icons
- **Loading:** Spinning icon with "Loading..." or "Opening Portal..." text
- **Disabled:** Disabled during any operation to prevent double-clicks

### Error Handling
- API failures gracefully fallback to subscription portal page
- Network errors show user-friendly error messages
- All errors are logged to console for debugging

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels and button states
- Loading states announced to screen readers
- Error messages are properly associated with buttons

## Files Modified
- `/app/billing/page.tsx` - Main billing page component
- Added button handlers and state management
- Added loading states and error handling
- Added success/error message display

## API Dependencies
- `/api/stripe/portal` - Creates Stripe customer portal sessions
- `/subscription/portal` - Subscription management page
- `/subscribe` - Subscription signup page

## Browser Compatibility
- Tested in modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Requires NextAuth.js session for authentication
- Uses Next.js router for navigation

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
Both buttons now function correctly with proper user feedback and error handling.
