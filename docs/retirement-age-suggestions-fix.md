# Retirement Age Suggestions Fix

## **🔧 Issue Resolved**

The smart auto-population logic for "Suggested Retirement Age" was not working correctly due to overly complex logic that required multiple fields to be filled before triggering suggestions.

## **❌ Previous Issues**

1. **Complex Logic**: Required years of service, service entry, and retirement group to all be filled
2. **Delayed Suggestions**: Users had to fill multiple fields before seeing suggestions
3. **Confusing Calculations**: Used complex benefit factor calculations instead of simple minimum ages
4. **Inconsistent Triggering**: useEffect dependencies prevented immediate feedback

## **✅ Solution Implemented**

### **1. Simplified Calculation Logic**

**Before** (Complex):
```typescript
// Required years of service, service entry, complex benefit calculations
if (yearsOfService >= 30) return groupRules.fullBenefitAge
if (yearsOfService >= 20) return Math.max(groupRules.minAge, groupRules.fullBenefitAge - 2)
return groupRules.fullBenefitAge
```

**After** (Simple):
```typescript
switch (group) {
  case '1': return 60  // Group 1 (General Employees)
  case '2': return 55  // Group 2 (Certain Public Safety)  
  case '3': return 55  // Group 3 (State Police)
  case '4': return 50  // Group 4 (Public Safety)
  default: return 60   // Default fallback
}
```

### **2. Immediate Triggering**

**Before**:
```typescript
// Required all three fields to be filled
useEffect(() => {
  if (data.retirementGroup && data.yearsOfService && data.serviceEntry) {
    // ... complex logic
  }
}, [data.retirementGroup, data.yearsOfService, data.serviceEntry])
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Triggers immediately when group is selected
useEffect(() => {
  if (data.retirementGroup) {
    const suggestedAge = calculateSuggestedRetirementAge(data.retirementGroup, data.yearsOfService || 0, data.serviceEntry || 'before_2012')
    if (suggestedAge !== data.plannedRetirementAge) {
      onChange({ ...data, plannedRetirementAge: suggestedAge })
    }
  }
}, [data.retirementGroup]) // Only trigger on group change
```

### **3. Clear Age Suggestions**

| Retirement Group | Suggested Age | Rationale |
|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Group 1** (General Employees) | **60** | Post-2012 minimum retirement age |
| **Group 2** (Certain Public Safety) | **55** | Minimum retirement age for group |
| **Group 3** (State Police) | **55** | Practical minimum (can retire earlier with 20+ years) |
| **Group 4** (Public Safety) | **50** | Minimum retirement age for group |

### **4. Updated Help Text**

**Before**: "Based on your group and years of service"
**After**: "Minimum retirement age for your group (you can adjust if needed)"

## **🧪 Testing Results**

All test cases pass with 100% success rate:

```
✅ Group 1: Age 60 (General Employees)
✅ Group 2: Age 55 (Certain Public Safety)  
✅ Group 3: Age 55 (State Police)
✅ Group 4: Age 50 (Public Safety)
✅ Invalid group defaults to Age 60
```
