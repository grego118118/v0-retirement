# Years of Service Field Clarification

## **üìã Issue Resolution**

The "Years of Service" field in the Essential Information step has been clarified to capture **CURRENT years of service** (as of today's date), not projected years at retirement.

## **üîç Analysis Results**

### **Why Current Years is Correct:**

1. **Existing Calculation Logic**: The standardized pension calculator uses current years and projects forward:
   ```typescript
   const projectedYearsOfService = yearsOfService + Math.max(0, retirementAge - currentAge)
   ```

2. **Eligibility Validation**: Users need to know if they meet minimum service requirements NOW
3. **Service Entry Detection**: Auto-detection works backward from current years to estimate start date
4. **User Understanding**: Users know their current service time, not future projections

## **‚úÖ Updates Made**

### **1. Field Label and Help Text**
- **Before**: "Years of Service"
- **After**: "Current Years of Service"
- **Help Text**: "Your current creditable service time as of today (we'll calculate projected years at retirement)"

### **2. Smart Auto-Population Logic** (`smart-defaults.ts`)
- Updated `calculateSuggestedRetirementAge()` to use current years and project forward
- Enhanced `validateRetirementAge()` to calculate projected years for validation
- Improved help text to clarify current vs projected distinction

### **3. Real-Time Calculation Preview**
- Enhanced `calculateBasicPensionEstimate()` to show projection details
- Added display of current vs projected years in preview
- Clear indication when calculation uses projected years

### **4. Validation Logic**
- Updated validation to check projected years at retirement
- Better error messages explaining years needed for eligibility
- Validation considers time until retirement for service requirements

## **üéØ User Experience Improvements**

### **Clear Distinction:**
- **Current Years**: What user enters (known value)
- **Projected Years**: What system calculates (current + additional years until retirement)

### **Visual Indicators:**
- Blue highlighting for auto-populated fields
- Projection details shown in live preview
- Clear labeling of "current" vs "projected" calculations

### **Helpful Guidance:**
- Contextual help text explains the distinction
- Validation messages reference projected years when relevant
- Live preview shows both current and projected years

## **üìä Example User Flow**

1. **User enters**: 25 current years of service
2. **User selects**: Retirement at age 65 (currently age 55)
3. **System calculates**: 25 + 10 = 35 projected years at retirement
4. **Live preview shows**: 
   - "Current years of service: 25"
   - "Projected years at retirement: 35"
   - "Additional years until retirement: 10"

## **üîß Technical Implementation**

### **Key Functions Updated:**
- `calculateSuggestedRetirementAge()` - Uses current years for suggestions
- `validateRetirementAge()` - Projects years for validation
- `calculateBasicPensionEstimate()` - Shows projection details
- `getFieldHelpText()` - Clarifies current vs projected

### **Calculation Accuracy Preserved:**
- All existing calculation functions remain unchanged
- New logic uses same projection methodology as existing system
- Mathematical accuracy maintained while improving UX

## **üéâ Benefits**

1. **Clearer User Understanding**: Users know exactly what to enter
2. **Better Validation**: System checks projected eligibility accurately
3. **Transparent Calculations**: Users see how projections are made
4. **Consistent Logic**: Aligns with existing calculation methodology
5. **Improved Guidance**: Contextual help prevents confusion

## **üìù Testing Recommendations**

### **Test Scenarios:**
1. **Current Service < Minimum**: Verify validation shows years needed
2. **Current Service + Projection ‚â• Minimum**: Verify eligibility validation passes
3. **Different Retirement Ages**: Verify projection calculations update correctly
4. **Service Entry Detection**: Verify auto-detection works from current years

### **Expected Behavior:**
- Field clearly labeled as "Current Years of Service"
- Help text explains projection methodology
- Live preview shows both current and projected values
- Validation considers projected years for eligibility

This clarification ensures the wizard provides accurate guidance while maintaining the mathematical precision of the existing calculation system.
