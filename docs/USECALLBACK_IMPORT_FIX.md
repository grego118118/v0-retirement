# useCallback Import Fix for PDF Generation System

## Problem Summary

The PDF generation system was throwing a `ReferenceError: useCallback is not defined` error at line 33 of `hooks/use-pdf-generation.ts`. This error occurred after adding the `refreshSubscriptionStatus` function using `useCallback` in the recent debugging enhancements to fix the premium status detection issue.

## Root Cause

The `useCallback` hook was being used in the `usePDFGeneration` hook but was not imported from React. The import statement only included `useState` and `useEffect`:

```typescript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE:
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

// Later in the code:
const refreshSubscriptionStatus = useCallback(async () => {
  // ReferenceError: useCallback is not defined
}, [session, status])
```

## Solution Applied

### Fixed Import Statement

**Before:**
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'
```

### File Modified

- **`hooks/use-pdf-generation.ts`** - Added `useCallback` to the React imports

## Verification

### 1. Import Statement Verification
All required React hooks are now properly imported:
- ✅ `useState` - for component state management
- ✅ `useEffect` - for side effects and API calls  
- ✅ `useCallback` - for memoized callback functions

### 2. Function Usage Verification
The `useCallback` is used correctly for the `refreshSubscriptionStatus` function:
```typescript
const refreshSubscriptionStatus = useCallback(async () => {
  if (status === 'loading' || status === 'unauthenticated' || !session?.user?.email) {
    return
  }
  // ... subscription fetching logic
}, [session, status])
```

### 3. Expected Behavior
- ✅ `/test-pdf` page loads without ReferenceError
- ✅ Enhanced subscription debugging component displays correctly
- ✅ Manual refresh functionality works
- ✅ All existing PDF generation functionality remains intact

## Impact

This fix resolves the blocking error that was preventing:
- The `/test-pdf` page from loading
- Testing of the premium status detection fixes
- Verification of the enhanced debugging features
- Access to the subscription debug component

## Related Features Restored

With this fix, the following features are now functional:
1. **Enhanced Subscription Debugging** - Real-time display of subscription status
2. **Manual Refresh** - Button to refresh subscription status manually
3. **Detailed Logging** - Console debugging for subscription status flow
4. **Error Tracking** - Display of subscription fetch errors
5. **Premium Status Detection** - Proper identification of premium users

## Testing Steps

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Visit `/test-pdf`** - Page should load without JavaScript errors
2. **Check Browser Console** - No ReferenceError should appear
3. **View Subscription Debug** - Component should display subscription information
4. **Test Manual Refresh** - "Refresh Hook State" button should work
5. **Monitor Console Logs** - Debug logs should appear when interacting with PDF features

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. **Always import required hooks** when adding new React hook usage
2. **Use TypeScript/ESLint** to catch undefined reference errors
3. **Test immediately** after adding new hook dependencies
4. **Review imports** when adding new functionality

## Conclusion

The `useCallback` import has been successfully added to the `usePDFGeneration` hook, resolving the ReferenceError and restoring full functionality to the PDF generation system. All recent debugging enhancements and subscription status detection improvements remain intact and are now accessible for testing and verification.
