feat: streamline main branch to core production features

- Remove social-security advanced features
- Remove tax calculator components
- Remove combined calculation wizard
- Remove scenario modeling features
- Keep core pension calculator and dashboard
- Maintain authentication and basic user management

This creates a production-ready core application that can be deployed immediately.

Advanced features remain available in the dev-features branch for continued development.
