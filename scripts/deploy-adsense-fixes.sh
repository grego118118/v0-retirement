ðŸŽ¯ AdSense Implementation Fixes:
- Implemented Google AdSense Auto Ads for immediate ad serving
- Enhanced manual ad units with better error handling and placeholder detection
- Added Auto Ads, Smart Ads, and improved Premium Alternative components
- Fixed AdSense initialization with premium user filtering
- Added comprehensive AdSense setup guide and troubleshooting documentation
- Improved error logging and diagnostics for AdSense issues

ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements:
- Auto Ads enable immediate ad serving without requiring specific ad unit IDs
- Smart Ads combine Auto Ads with manual ad unit fallbacks
- Enhanced placeholder ad slot detection (warns about fake IDs like 4567890123)
- Better premium user filtering to ensure ads only show for free users
- Comprehensive test page with Auto Ads, manual ads, and Smart Ads testing

ðŸ“‹ Components Added/Updated:
- AutoAds component for Google AdSense Auto Ads
- AutoAdsPlaceholder for layout and development testing
- SmartAds component combining Auto + manual ad strategies
- Enhanced AdSenseInitializer with Auto Ads support
- Improved ResponsiveAd and other manual ad components
- Updated test-adsense page with comprehensive testing tools

ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results:
- Auto Ads should display immediately if AdSense account is approved
- Manual ads will work once real ad unit IDs are configured
- Premium users see ad-free experience with Premium Alternative component
- Better diagnostics and error handling for AdSense troubleshooting
