## üö® Current Issue: Placeholder Ad Unit IDs

**Problem**: The website is using placeholder ad slot IDs instead of real Google AdSense ad unit IDs, which prevents ads from displaying.

**Solution**: Create real ad units in Google AdSense dashboard and update environment variables.

- Place ads in optimal locations
- No manual ad unit creation required
- Revenue starts immediately (if account approved)
