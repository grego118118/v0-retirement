# Billing Page Horizontal Margin Implementation

## Overview
Successfully applied the same horizontal margin/padding system to the billing page that was implemented across all other pages of the Massachusetts Retirement System website. The billing page now has consistent spacing and prevents content from extending to browser edges.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made to `app/billing/page.tsx`

#### Before:
```jsx
return (
  <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 via-blue-50/30 to-indigo-50/20 dark:from-slate-950 dark:via-blue-950/20 dark:to-indigo-950/10">
    <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8 lg:py-16 max-w-4xl">
```

#### After:
```jsx
return (
  <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-50 via-blue-50/30 to-indigo-50/20 dark:from-slate-950 dark:via-blue-950/20 dark:to-indigo-950/10 mrs-page-wrapper">
    <div className="mrs-content-container py-8 lg:py-16 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Added `.mrs-page-wrapper`** class to the main container for responsive horizontal margins
2. **Added `.mrs-content-container`** class for proper content centering and max-width
3. **Removed conflicting classes**: `container mx-auto px-4` 
4. **Preserved existing constraints**: `max-w-4xl mx-auto` for optimal reading experience
5. **Maintained all functionality**: All billing features, styling, and interactions preserved

| 769px-1024px | 2rem (32px) | Tablet/small desktop |
